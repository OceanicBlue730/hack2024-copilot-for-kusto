Copilot for Kusto Insights
=================
## Unlock Insights with Ease, Simplify Data Analysis

Project Description:
----------------------
Integrating Copilot with Kusto Explorer to Generate KQL Queries and Obtain Insights from Records Using Natural Language

## 1. Problem Statement
-------------------------
A key part of resolving customer issues with various Microsoft products and services involves analyzing backend logs. Support staff and product teams usually need to run Kusto queries and manually identify trends and patterns in the extracted records to understand the root cause of the problem. Considerable time is spent on locating and crafting these queries, adjusting them for diverse customer scenarios, extracting relevant data, and creating visualizations like charts and tables for incident reports sent to the product team, as well as preparing Excel sheets or similar files with shareable data for customers. New engineers also need to invest time in learning KQL syntax. Moreover, many customers utilise KQL queries in services such as Log Analytics, often opening support cases where they seek assistance in finding the right queries to obtain correct results.

Copilot for Kusto Insights is a tool designed to simplify the process of extracting insights on customers’ usage of different services from backend logs. By integrating Copilot with Kusto, engineers and customers can leverage natural language processing to compose KQL queries, identify patterns in the records retrieved, and derive insights, all through prompts in simple English. The tool aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis, making it accessible to Microsoft engineers and customers with varying levels of expertise in KQL, thus reducing the time taken to troubleshoot intricate issues.

## 2. Key Features of the Solution
----------------------------------
•	Natural Language Interface for Users: Engineers can write Kusto queries using simple English language, eliminating the need for deep knowledge of KQL syntax. This feature leverages natural language processing to translate user commands into accurate Kusto queries.

•	Maintain the Context of the Conversation: The Copilot will keep distinct contexts for each tab, and the session will terminate when the tab is closed.

•	Filtering out Irrelevant Records: The tool shall also be able to filter out irrelevant results based on prompts input in natural language, ensuring that only the most pertinent data is presented. For example, if a user asks for records corresponding to a particular operation or calls made between specific timestamps, the tool will focus on those criteria and exclude unrelated data.

•	Inherently Compliant Queries: Copilot for Kusto aims to comply with different compliance guidelines set for different teams, for example, the EUDB compliance guidelines and PII/EUI/EUPII/etc. which will ensure the queries are processed in respective geographies and help ensure that output also doesn’t contain any PII.
Additionally, visibility will be limited to the connections that are added, ensuring the user retains access solely to the records and tables they are authorized to view.

•	Detecting Patterns in Logs – Intelligent Overview: When troubleshooting customer problems, users often need to identify patterns in the retrieved records, such as specific error codes, recurring operations, or types of APIs used. The Copilot will facilitate this process by recommending patterns it has detected in the output of the executed query.

•	Optimized and Cost-Effective Queries: While users learn to make their queries specific, less resource-intensive and precise, this Copilot will help them speed up the journey by suggesting an optimized version of their query which will result in faster results and less resource consumption on Kusto clusters.

•	Prompt Suggestions to Start the Conversation: Copilot for Kusto Insights shall be able to propose initial prompts to initiate troubleshooting, such as "Fetch logs for me," and then progressively request details like resource IDs, timestamps, etc. (the typical Copilot interaction).

•	Proposing Follow-Up Questions and Enhancing Results: When analyzing a large or unfamiliar dataset to pinpoint an issue or discover a pattern, Copilot can help you explore the data from various perspectives. Some of these suggestions might be more beneficial than others for comprehending and presenting the data. For example, after displaying records as a bar chart, asking “Would a line chart be preferable?” can be advantageous.

## 3. Solution Using Azure Architecture
-----------------------------------------
The approach utilizes Azure OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) to handle English language prompts and leverages its code-generation capabilities for creating KQL queries. The Assistants API facilitates the Copilot experience, ensuring distinct message contexts are preserved for each tab in the Data Explorer or Kusto Explorer interface using threads.
•	Azure Data Explorer: Acts as the interface for Copilot conversations. Data is retrieved using standard Kusto queries. The Copilot icon is present in every tab, enabling the user to access it whenever needed.
•	Azure OpenAI: Used for its Natural language processing (NLP) to handle English language prompts and leverages its code-generation capabilities for creating and fine-tuning KQL queries. 

## 4. User Interface
-------------------
The UI would be like that of the DfM Copilot, with a Copilot icon added to every tab on the Data Explorer.
